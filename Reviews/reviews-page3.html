            <p class="review-text">We could not be happier with our experience finding coda. The day we found him on puppyspur-haven.site is the same day we were blessed to meet him thanks to the flexibility and kindness of his breeder Sarah & Jessica. We took a quick drive for about 4 hour and a half, Matt, Christine, and instantly fell in love with Koda. (His name was Dallas then.). Koda seemed to be everything you would want in a puppy, as well as nurtured, loved, and very healthy. he was not yet eight weeks he had a few more days to go. We had to go home without him, but we appreciated the breeders respect for doing the best for Koda. After just a few days and a couple trips to Petsmart, we returned to the Sauders’ to bring Koda home. He has brought so much joy and happiness to our family and to anyone who visits us. He’s had wonderful check ups, adjusted very smoothly to the various transitions, and is very happy with his home and family. I am so grateful for finding koda and how quickly the whole process went. We could tell he had been very well cared for before he got here and he continues to be in very good hands, he’s extremely loved and is the happiest puppy. His personality makes us smile and laugh all the time! we love koda more every day, he is a very important part of our family. Thank you so much for making him available to us. laurxo</p>

            <p class="review-text">My wife had been looking for a companion, specifically, a Pembroke corgi, for several mos. after meeting and falling in love with her friends’ ” Winnie “. Perusing the puppyspur website we found ( breeders ) sarah’s posting for, what we discovered, was the sweetest, funniest, and most loving little corgi…our Bella. Bella is an F1 lol, Both are registered. THANKS! sarah for the health and grooming tips and the start up supplies and, and, and most of all for our Bella….
Thanks to puppyspur for the access to the quality breeders you rep. We wanted foremost to avoid “mills” and the Sowers were prefect.</p>

            <p class="review-text">On May 1, 2023, I drove from Massachusetts to Hillsboro, TX, to pick up a Shichon I saw on the website.
The minute he walked to me with then “Gina” in his arms, I knew this was my baby. It was love at first site, she is so alert, active, funny, easily trainable. I named her Princess Poppie, and the name fits her. Everyone that meets her falls in love with her. When I got her I had lost my 12 yr old CORGI and was heartbroken, but Poppie instantly stole my heart! I would recommend Puppyspur to anyone looking for their forever dog!!.</p>

            <p class="review-text">My boyfriend and I picked this baby up on 11/21/23. Mr. Michael met us at our car with him and invited us into his home to look over paperwork and answer any questions or concerns. His boys were so cute and polite. I am sooooo happy with my puppy!!! He’s the cutest! My family loves him, my friends, and most of all I do. He’s spoiled and loved and currently socializing with family dogs and the world. Side note: He’s growing by the minute 😂. Thank you Michael and family!!🖤🤎🧡</p>

            <p class="review-text">I’m so glad I chose to buy a puppy from PuppysPur(sarah miller), she is such a nice woman and takes good care of her dogs. They are all happy, clean, and well fed. She showed us where the puppies live and it’s well kept. Her puppies are so playful and sweet. My son is so happy with Buttercup, Thank you Sarah!! I will be referring people to her for sure! 🙂</p>

            <p class="review-text">Picked up our puppy April 16 and couldn’t be more excited and happy with her. Our first Cockapoo was unfortunately a “puppymill”puppy. She was sweet, but never as spirited and smart as our Chloe is. She’s affectionate, cute and already running our household. Jessica Thompson was super to work with and a visit to his farm to pin her up was encouraging when we saw 5 little Red and white bundles of joy welcome us with barks and affection. Our next dog will undoubtedly be from Jessica. Great experience!</p>
